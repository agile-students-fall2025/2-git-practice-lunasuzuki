# Article Reflection
I thought this article was interesting especially because of the recent buzz of AI and the idea that it might replace software engineers. I liked how it highlighted the importance of the human mind and creativity. It made me realize how much of software engineering, or any career, depends on aspects that AI cant replace. I also liked how the article acknowledged the power of AI, such as its ability in automating tasks and improving efficiency, while still emphasizing that the creative and collaborative parts of engineering are very much human strengths.

My CS202 (Operating Systems) professor strongly emphasizes the need to master systems and system design, a highly covetted skill required by an AI advancement endeavors. The Professor said that AI can reasonably perform entry and junior-level work; however, it is still advanced enough to do senior-level engineering work. Thus, the nexus between my Professor's speech and this article is that, while AI can do some rudimentary software tasks, it still requires human oversight and necesitates skillful implementation of systems.
